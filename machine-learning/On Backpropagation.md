# interesting readings
- who invented it: https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html
- how it works: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/
# interesting videos
- how it works but as video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0
- intuitively explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U
- the math explained (different explanation approach than video #1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8

I would consider this as a very important individual topic of ML since the implementation of backpropagation for neural networks changed a lot in terms of computational costs. So, it made it possible for us to have these HUGE neural networks and we can train them in a reasonable time.
